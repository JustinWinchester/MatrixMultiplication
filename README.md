# MatrixMultiplication
============================   ==  ==  READ ME  =  =  ===========================================
This is a read me file with instrucitons for compilaiton of a computer program Justin_Winchester_Project2/
This computer program performs Matrix Mutiplication which is studied in Algebra. 
The result of the program is the product matrix of two matrices that have been entered in
by the user of the program and then multiplied together via there corresponding columns and 
rows. The only way that matrix mltiplication is defined is the only way the user will be allowed
to perform multiplication as a result the column size of the first matrix must be equal to the 
size of the row(s) of the second matrix.
